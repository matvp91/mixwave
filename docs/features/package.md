# Package

Video packaging refers to the process of preparing a video file for delivery and consumption by users across different devices and platforms.

- The video is split into smaller segments or chunks, usually a few seconds long, to facilitate adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR), which adjusts quality based on network conditions.
- A manifest file (m3u8 for HLS) is generated. It contains metadata about the available segments, bitrates, and resolutions, helping the player know what content to request based on the userâ€™s network conditions.

## API

The package job will prepare an HLS playlist for your asset. Before you package, check the [transcode](/features/transcode) instructions.

::: code-group

```sh [shell]
curl -X POST https://api.domain.com/package
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -d "{body}"
```

:::

A minimal body payload may look like this:

```json
{
  "assetId": "f7e89553-0d3b-4982-ba7b-3ce5499ac689"
}
```

Your asset is now available for playback at:

```
{S3_PUBLIC_URL}/package/f7e89553-0d3b-4982-ba7b-3ce5499ac689/hls/master.m3u8
```

::: tip
Each package result is uploaded to /package/{assetId}/hls/master.m3u8
:::

### Alternative name

By default, the package job pushes the result to a folder named `hls`. You can use the `name` param to change the output folder. Think of it this way, we'd like to package a plain HLS playlist by default, but we want for the same transcode result a DRM (encrypted) playlist, which we then call `hls_drm`.

```json
{
  "assetId": "f7e89553-0d3b-4982-ba7b-3ce5499ac689",
  "name": "hls_drm"
}
```

Your asset is now available for playback at:

```
{S3_PUBLIC_URL}/package/f7e89553-0d3b-4982-ba7b-3ce5499ac689/hls_drm/master.m3u8
```
