# HLS.js

This is a build of the master branch of https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js

This build contains "HLS Interstitials" support (https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/issues/5730), which has recently been merged in master.

Once HLS.js publishes v1.6.0, this package will be removed. Use with caution, and do not rely on this package in production.
