# Thank You

We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the incredible open source projects that form the backbone of our work.

- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - a collection of libraries and tools to process multimedia content such as audio, video, subtitles and related metadata.
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) - a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.

Keep up the awesome work!
